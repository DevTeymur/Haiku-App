# Haiku-App

The main idea of this project is to create a Haiku server in C programming language which is capable of receiving signals from the client and displaying the corresponding haiku category on the console. The development process is divided into two parts which are the client and server-side. Every application has its functionalities and they interact with each other using the message queues and signals in the local machine. Multiple versions are developed to build one final product.
